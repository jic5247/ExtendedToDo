[Stackoverflow: How to manage start activity for result on Android?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10407159/how-to-manage-start-activity-for-result-on-android)

Time spent: around 6 hours

Completed User Stories:

* [x] Successfully add and remove items from the todo list within my app
* [x] Include support for editing todo items
* [x] Persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart
 
Notes:

Spent around 3 hours to watch the walk-thought videos to set up "Android Studio" and type codes for the initial 2 user stories. Spent around another 3 hours to design the second activity of edit item and did research on "StartActvityForResult()", "Intent" and "Intent.putExtras()". This is a very out-standing introductory tutorial for a beginner toward Android development.

Walkthrough of all user stories:
